1. Introduction to
Statistics

- Definition and scope of statistics
- Types: Descriptive vs Inferential
- Population vs Sample
- Types of Data
(Qualitative/Quantitative)

2 Understand basic statistical terms and the role
of statistics in data analysis.

2. Data Collection &
Organization

- Methods of data collection
- Types of scales (Nominal, Ordinal,
Interval, Ratio)
- Frequency distribution
- Tabulation and classification

3 Collect and organize data systematically for
analysis.

3. Data Visualization

- Bar charts, histograms, pie charts
- Line graphs, boxplots
- Frequency polygons and ogives

3 Represent data graphically using various chart
types.

4. Measures of Central
Tendency

- Mean, Median, Mode
- Properties and applications
- Weighted mean, combined mean

3 Calculate and interpret average values of
datasets.

5. Measures of Dispersion

- Range, Variance, Standard
Deviation
- Interquartile range
- Coefficient of variation

3 Analyze how data is spread around the central
value.

6. Skewness and Kurtosis

- Definition and types of skewness
- Measuring peakedness of data
(kurtosis)
- Interpretation using graphs and
formulas

2 Identify the shape of data distribution using
skewness and kurtosis.

7. Correlation Analysis

- Pearson's correlation
- Spearman's rank correlation
- Scatter plots

3 Measure and interpret the strength and
direction of relationships between variables.

8. Regression Analysis
(Linear)

- Introduction to regression
- Simple linear regression
- Estimating regression equations
- Interpretation of slope and intercept

4 Predict outcomes using linear regression
models.

9. Probability Basics

- Classical, empirical, and subjective
probability
- Rules of probability
- Independent and mutually exclusive
events

3 Understand and apply basic probability
concepts to real-world problems.

10. Probability
Distributions

- Discrete: Binomial, Poisson
- Continuous: Normal distribution
- Properties and applications

3 Use probability distributions to model
different types of data.

11. Sampling and
Sampling Distributions

- Types of sampling (random,
stratified, etc.)
- Central Limit Theorem
- Standard error

3 Understand how samples represent
populations and affect statistical inference.

12. Hypothesis Testing

- Null and alternative hypothesis
- Type I & II errors
- Z-test, t-test (1-sample, 2-sample),
p-value

4 Test assumptions about data using statistical
methods.

13. Mini Project / Case
Study

- Data collection
- Applying descriptive & inferential
statistics
- Presenting findings

4 Apply the complete statistical process to a
real-world problem and present analysis.
